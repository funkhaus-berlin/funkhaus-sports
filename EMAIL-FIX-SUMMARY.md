# Email Sending Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Premature email blocking**: The `emailSent` flag was preventing retry attempts even when emails failed
2. **Silent failures**: Email sending errors were caught but not properly handled
3. **Missing validation**: No check for `emailSentAt` timestamp to confirm successful send

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Email Send Check (stripe-webhook.ts, lines 565-586)
- Now checks both `emailSent` AND `emailSentAt` to confirm successful email delivery
- Warns and retries if `emailSent` is true but `emailSentAt` is missing
- Added proper error handling with `catchError` to continue payment success even if email fails

### 2. Improved Email Status Tracking (stripe-webhook.ts, lines 640-661)
- Only sets `emailSent: true` when email is actually sent successfully
- Adds `emailSentAt` timestamp only on success
- On failure, sets `emailSent: false` and records `emailFailedAt` and `emailError`
- Removed the `filter` that was silently dropping failed email attempts

### 3. Added Debug Logging (stripe-webhook.ts, lines 622-629)
- Logs email attempt details including recipient and data structure
- Helps identify missing fields or configuration issues

### 4. Created Debug Tool (debug-resend-email.ts)
- New function to check bookings without emails
- Can force resend emails for specific bookings
- Helps identify patterns in email failures

## How to Test

1. **Check recent bookings without emails**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://funkhaus-sports.netlify.app/api/debug-resend-email
   ```

2. **Debug specific booking**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://funkhaus-sports.netlify.app/api/debug-resend-email \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"bookingId": "YOUR_BOOKING_ID"}'
   ```

3. **Force resend email**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://funkhaus-sports.netlify.app/api/debug-resend-email \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"bookingId": "YOUR_BOOKING_ID", "forceResend": true}'
   ```

## Root Causes to Check

1. **Missing customer email**: Ensure `customerEmail` or `userEmail` is set in booking
2. **Resend API issues**: Check if RESEND_API_KEY environment variable is set correctly
3. **Email template errors**: Check for missing required fields in email data
4. **Network issues**: Transient failures in Resend API calls

## Monitoring

Check Netlify function logs for:
- "Attempting to send email for booking..." messages
- "Failed to send confirmation email..." errors
- "Email already successfully sent..." skip messages

## Next Steps

1. Deploy these changes
2. Monitor logs for email sending patterns
3. Use debug tool to identify and resend failed emails
4. Consider implementing a scheduled function to retry failed emails automatically
